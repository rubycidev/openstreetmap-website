# OpenStreetMap's data is available for free in bulk from https://planet.openstreetmap.org
# For regional extracts and documentation, see https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm
# We encourage you to use these instead of scraping our site.
# Scraping puts a high load on our donated resources and will lead to your IP being blocked.
# Please respect our resources, and help us keep the service free and accessible for everyone.
